[17:18:36] [TaskChainAsyncQueue Thread 0/INFO]: [Guilds] Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug loading old challenges when using MySQL backend
- Fixed a bug where the admin upgrade command and guild tickets were not respecting perm changes
- Fixed a bug where a user would not be able to challenge another guild if their previous war ended with no user from each guild joining the war
- Fixed a bug where the guild role node for a player was not properly being applied


Changes
- Updated SlimJar dependency to fix some relocation NPEs being thrown
- Overhauled the Role + Tier permission system handling backend (please let me know if you experience any problems)
- Updated the library handle to a new version that is the result from a discussion with the library developer. There was an issue where it was checking the client locale of all players online every second without a cache. This started showing up on the main thread. It now checks less often and has a cache so it's not as intensive.
- The enum value for the team / ally chat can now be translated
- Updated XSeries to 3.4.0
- Updated Kotlin to 1.5.30
